            <p>Exercise - Locking down our API endpoints</p>





<p>Requirements</p>







<p>1. Go through each route in our API and add the authenticate middleware to every route in which data will be added or modified on the server. By adding this middleware only to those routes, you effectively have a public read-only API. </p>







<p>2. Register another user or two.</p>







<p>3. Log in with each of these users and copy and paste the token returned into a file just so you will have it handy. </p>







<p>4. Experiment with each endpoint in our API. Ensure that all endpoints with the authenticate middleware do in fact require a token and the others do not.</p>







<p>The End Result</p>







<p>At the end of this challenge, you should have a public read-only API. To access the endpoints that either add or modify data on the server, you will have to include an authorization header and a Bearer token for access.</p>
