            <p>Exercise - Diving deeper into JavaScript and ES6</p>





<p>Requirements</p>







<p>1. If you are brand new to JavaScript, pick some of the lessons you had a little trouble with and type them in. Get them to run and then change them up. Substitute your own values and objects in for the ones in the video. Try to spend at least a little time coding every day. The best way to learn is through practice and repetition.</p>







<p>2. Investigate ES6 further. If you already have a good understanding of JavaScript, check out http://exploringjs.com/es6/. This is a free-to-read online book that quickly covers ES6 in a lot of depth. If you are still fairly new to JavaScript, then https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read#leanpub-auto-about-this-book is a free-to-read online book that covers ES6 in depth as well, just more targeted toward a newer programmer.</p>







<p>3. In these books and Google searches, see if you can find ES6 features that I didnâ€™t talk about in this course. Look up examples of those features and type some code to get familiar with them.</p>







<p>The End Result</p>







<p>A better understanding of both JavaScript and especially ES6 :)</p>
