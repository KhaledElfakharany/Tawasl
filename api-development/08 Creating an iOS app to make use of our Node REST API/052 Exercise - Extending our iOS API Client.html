            <p>Requirements</p>





<p>In our iOS API Client application, we only implemented functionality for some of the available endpoints in our api. As an exercise, here are some things you now have the ability to implement yourself.</p>







<p>1. Add a ModifyTruckVC so that a selected food truck can be modified. Remember that you will have to add a method to the DataService to handle this. You will also have to be sure the user is authenticated before attempting to complete the PUT method that this endpoint uses.</p>







<p>2. Add a RemoveTruckVC so that a selected food truck can be removed. Again, you will need to add the appropriate method in the DataService and check for authentication.</p>







<p>3. Instead of entering coordinates manually, you might want to place a pin at the users current location and store the lat/long values for the food truck. This would take some more exploration of MapKit, but would be a really cool feature to implement.</p>







<p>4. Along the same lines as #3, you might want to be able to enter an address and then use a geocoding service to obtain the lat/long for the truck. Once you have the lat/long, you could store those in your database.</p>







<p>5. The UI could be greatly improved in this app.</p>







<p>The End Result</p>







<p>At the end of this challenge, you should have a really nice looking, full-fledged app for keeping up with popular food trucks. You will also be able to call yourself a “Full-stack Developer” since you have built both the backend and client for this solution….congratulations!</p>
